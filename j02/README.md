#My journey into Unity
  I began my final semester finding out I wanted to take my degree into the video game industry and with that 
I began my journey of learning the Unity game engine to make use of in my senior computer science capstone and for use in the future. 
In my journey I have to say the hardest steps of unity are easily the beginning and the end of learning how to make use of the engine. 
The end of learning the engine is essentially learning to reverse engineer it to make it do what you want with as little resistance as possible 
while the beginning is stepping into a new software with its own standards for the first time and in this article, 
I will be focusing on the perspective of a beginner.

  Right off the bat something that is challenging to a new user who isn’t use to software managers similar to how Microsoft Office works
in conjunction with Word, Powerpoint, and Exccel in this case I’m talking about Unity Hub which creates the projects the editor uses, 
keeps tracks of your project on your computer storage,  which version of the unity editor each project is using, AND which software your unity software can build for.

  For example, unless you have downloaded the MacOS package for unity hub you will not be able to build a game for MacOS 
and this is for every version of editor you have installed which could easily be done by asking at the start of the project 
what systems you intend to develop for. If you are tech have the prior knowledge this won’t be confusing but considering much of
Unity’s users are new and upcoming developers, this can be a lot to take in all at once.

  That was all Unity Hub the manager for the editor itself is a different ball game and where a lot learning as you go begins unless
you watch tutorials on how to make use of the editor and inspector of the software and realistically speaking unless you have the 
time you are going to make use of a tutorial of teacher like I did.

  Above is a snapshot of my capstone project and general layout to the very left is the hierarchy tab which shows the general sorting of the 
game objects within the given scene you are working on. To the right of the hierarchy tab is the scene tab and to the right of that is the game tab. 
The scene is the view of your game from and editor’s view where you can point and click to edit objects in the scene while the game tab gives you a 
view of the game to how your game user will see it. Finally, to the very is the inspector tab which allows you to view and edit a given game object 
whether to change its current value to add components to it such as a script, collision body, or a sprite renderer. The bottom tabs consist of the project 
and console tab. The console tab gives you access to the console while run the game in the editor for debugging and the project tab shows you the directory hierarchy
of the project. All the tabs can be moved around to adjust to a layout you like and additional tabs can be made as well. At the very top you have even more tabs.
The file tab allows you save the project or scene, open or create a new project. The edit tab gives you options of editing the scene and more.
The asset tab gives you access to edit the assets you are using if any. The GameObject tab gives you access to game object controls,
Components is a quick access to components for game objects, and the Window tab allows you to affect your screen layout and quick access
to other general uses you may need. Lastly the Help tab is self-explanatory.

  As you can see it is a lot to take in, we haven’t even gotten into unity packages or actual coding which is done using a 
3rd party code editor software such as Visual Studios or VS Code. And while it is overwhelmingly at the start, once you gain that initial understanding
you begin to find things much easier and there is a nice flow to where everything is. Overall while scary at first I am happy I begun my Unity journey,
now I can began my journey into make it do what I want when developing games, and attempting to make packages and assets do what I want all while trying to stay sane
..wish me luck.
